# 🏢 Small Office Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

A Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating a small office network using VLANs, inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), and a centralized DHCP server. This network is designed for efficient segmentation, IP management, and inter-department communication in a small business environment.

## 🔧 Project Features

- 🔹 VLAN segmentation for HR, IT, and Finance departments
- 🔹 Inter-VLAN routing using router subinterfaces
- 🔹 Centralized DHCP server with separate pools for each VLAN
- 🔹 Fully functional PC-to-PC and PC-to-server connectivity
- 🔹 Trunk links between switches and router

## 🌐 IP Addressing & VLANs

| Department | VLAN | Gateway         | DHCP Range              |
|------------|------|------------------|--------------------------|
| HR         | 10   | 192.168.10.1     | 192.168.10.11 - 192.168.10.254 |
| IT         | 20   | 192.168.20.1     | 192.168.20.11 - 192.168.20.254 |
| Finance    | 30   | 192.168.30.1     | 192.168.30.11 - 192.168.30.254 |

The DHCP Server (`192.168.30.10`) is statically configured in the Finance VLAN.
